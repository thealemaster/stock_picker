Coding exercise for work

I decided to try to learn a few things about Python by doing a code exercise with some people at work. It's also my intent to do some TDD along with it to learn more about Python's testing capabilities.

My understanding of the user stories for this exercise are:
- As a stock trader, I want to buy a stock at it's lowest price low and sell a stock at it's highest price so that I can maximize profit.
- As a stock trader, I want to see an error returned if there is no solution to making a profit.
